## Problem Statement
The main problem that we are trying to solve is actually resides in the todays technique used for glaucoma testing.

Main Drawbacks of Traditional Glaucoma Testing - 
``` bash
       1.Unaffordable               2. Misdiagnosis                      3. Early Detection not possible 
       4.Time Consuming             5. Very rarely available             6. Highly Expensive Machines
```

## Proposed Solution 
I have build a AI powered low cost glaucoma detection system named EarlySpot. That has an accuracy level of more than 90 %.  
User had to just input the image of the fundus region of eye  and it automatically detects weather the person is suffering from glaucoma or not.
As simple as that. 

#### EarlySpot is integrated with web app to deliver it to potential users. The fronted of this web application is built using React Framework.

## Technologies and Tools to be Used
* Keras - A High Level Deep Learning API to Use Neural Network in Project.
* Tensorflow - It is used by keras to perform low level operation or as a Backend Engine. Theano and CNTK can be used in place of Tensorflow
* Jupyter Notebook - A platform through which you can access all libraries and use them according to your requirement. It is used to implement your Logic.
* Google Colab - Google Colab can be used as online jupyter notebook since it provides free GPU which are must with this Project because the dataset is Huge.
* Kaggle - Even kaggle can be used where you can upload your data and work with that data and the dataset of this project is present on kaggle so creating notebook on kaggle will be beneficial.
* Python - Python is a language through which this whole project is made and it is used to create model via Jupyter notebook libraries and also used to create web app.
* Flask - Flask is a Micro-Framework for web development by which we can create web app like I did.
* HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language is used for loading static contents on a web page.
* CSS - Cascading Style Sheet is used to add Style on our page to make it more attractive.
* JavaScript - It is scripting language used for uploading dynamic content in this project client side scripting is used with JavaScript rather than Server side.
* GitHub - It is used to deploy the project and after deploying it on github we can connect our repository to any cloud service provider.
* React - React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components.
* Heroku CLI - It is used to deploy the project on Heroku server which provides the server for web app deployment to users.

## Benefits
EarlySpot is making glaucoma Testing :
* Easily available  
* Affordable   
* Efficient

So, through EarlySpot glaucoma can be detected early , conveniently and also at a fraction of cost.In this way EarlySpot is going to revolutionize the whole glaucoma detection system.

## Future Scope and further enhancement of this application
* In future, the app will be added with  more diseases or classes of model such that it can be used on many eye diseases.
* One great feature that we want in future to include in EarlySpot is that it will also  connect the glaucoma patients to their nearest eye doctor for further eye check-up because we have observe that to find  a good ophthalmologist is a extremely tedious task . 
So in future we also provide the links of ophthalmologist to the glaucoma patients for  further glaucoma diagnosis.

## Conclusion
EarlySpot is an extremely worthwhile device. Due to its ability in serving remote areas that lack major equipments for detecting glaucoma. We know that this tool can not take laboratory like images .
But we believe that in remote areas having a less powerful tool is better then having none. So, through EarlySpot glaucoma can be detected early , conveniently and also at a fraction of cost.
In this way EarlySpot is going to revolutionize the whole glaucoma detection system.
